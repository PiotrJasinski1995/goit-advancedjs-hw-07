/*
  Your task will be to create two classes â€“ Employee and Manager.

  The Employee class should include:

  a name property, which will be available to everyone.

  a department property, which will be available only within the Employee class.

  a salary property, which will be available only within the Employee class and its subclasses.

  The Manager class should be a subclass of the Employee class.

  You need to implement a constructor in the Manager class that will call the superclass constructor and increment salary by 10000.
